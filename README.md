# Non-IID-Data-Skew-Label-Distribution-Skew
LabelSkewSplitter is a Python package designed to split datasets based on label distribution skew. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to create client-specific datasets with varying label distributions, such as in federated learning simulations or distributed machine learning environments.
